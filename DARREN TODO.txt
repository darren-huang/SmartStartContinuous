BIGGER POINT:                                   DONE
                                                Get Smart Start Tests running
                                                First need to refactor the NND_MB_agent
                                                    add choosing save model directory
                                                        add new model gen (always new directory) ? kinda already build in
                                                    add choosing load model directory
                                                    add turning off save model
                                                    remove get_data_directory from utilities.py (i dont think its needed)
                                                        maybe update the old experimenter and plotter examples while i'm at it :)
                                                Move the current run0 files into the data directory
                                                Change the main methods for NND_MB and smart start to defaultly load up the default training data
                                                add options into Smartstart for setting the NND_MB stuffs
                                                add options into Smartstart experimenter
                                                RUN THEN WE GOOOOOOD!? (of course not)
	WE GOOOOOOOD!
                                                Decaying SmartStart change (eta) value -> exploration decay


                                                adjust distance function (currently 1 step in one dimension = distance of 1, switch to 1 step in ALL dimensions = distance of 1)
                                                Change distance function to take in multiple (from both sides, output matrix)
                                                Path shortcuts
                                                Added Waypoint Give ups
                                                Fully switch to parallel smart start calc

                                                run experiments

                                                plotting options



                                                get_smart_start_path documentation
                                                Installation guide: -> explain how to setup pipenv stuffs
                                                Explain how to run SmartStarts, especially how Neural Network Dynamics Agent works (Training data and such)
                                                (could be better ^)
Document Stuffs
Github Readme References (bart's stuff)
Delete unused code
fix paper references -> TODO's, these will reference the research papers
Refactor it such that "get default data directory" uses relative paths, not absolute
MERGE WITH MASTER :OOOOO
