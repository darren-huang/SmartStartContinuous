BIGGER POINT:
Get Smart Start Tests running
	First need to refactor the NND_MB_agent
		add choosing save model directory
			add new model gen (always new directory) ? kinda already build in
		add choosing load model directory
		add turning off save model
		remove get_data_directory from utilities.py (i dont think its needed)
			maybe update the old experimenter and plotter examples while i'm at it :)
	Move the current run0 files into the data directory
	Change the main methods for NND_MB and smart start to defaultly load up the default training data
	add options into Smartstart for setting the NND_MB stuffs
	add options into Smartstart experimenter
	RUN THEN WE GOOOOOOD!?
